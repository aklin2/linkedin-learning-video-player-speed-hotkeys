# linkedin-learning-video-player-speed-hotkeys
A firefox extension for adding video player speed hotkeys

## How to use
This is intended for MacOS Firefox, but if there are more users, let me know please. Or create an issue.

### Install Firefox Extension
TODO: add here

### Hotkeys
There are 7 speeds, linked to 7 hotkeys:
1. Alt+Shift+1 = 0.50x speed
2. Alt+Shift+2 = 0.75x speed
3. Alt+Shift+3 = 1.00x speed
4. Alt+Shift+4 = 1.25x speed
5. Alt+Shift+5 = 1.50x speed
6. Alt+Shift+6 = 1.75x speed
7. Alt+Shift+7 = 2.00x speed

For MacOS, the 'Alt' key is the 'Option' key.
So for example, to do 1.50x speed on MacOS, do this key combination: 'Option+Shift+5'.
